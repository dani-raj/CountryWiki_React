# 🌍 CountryWiki React

An interactive **React + TypeScript** app that showcases data from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/).  
You can search, filter by continent, language or currency, save visited countries, and even test yourself with a flag quiz.  

👉 **Live demo here:** [CountryWiki React](https://dani-raj.github.io/CountryWiki_React/)

## Features
- Browse countries with flags and detailed information  
- Filter by continent, language, and currency  
- Save your own “Visited Countries” list (stored in localStorage)  
- Fun quiz: guess the country by its flag *(let me know if you can get 10/10, because I don’t think it’s possible 😄)*
- Fully responsive design (mobile + desktop)  

## Tech Stack
- **React 19** + **TypeScript**  
- **Vite** build tool
- **React Router**
- **CSS Modules** for styling  
- **LocalStorage** for persistence
